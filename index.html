          The Grampians National Park (also Gariwerd), commonly referred to as
          The Grampians, is a national park located in the Grampians region of
          Victoria, Australia. The 167,219-hectare (413,210-acre) national park
          is situated between Stawell and Horsham on the Western Highway and
          Dunkeld on the Glenelg Highway, 260 kilometres (160 mi) west of
          Melbourne and 460 kilometres (290 mi) east of Adelaide. Proclaimed as
          a national park on 1 July 1984, the park was listed on the Australian
          National Heritage List on 15 December 2006 for its outstanding natural
          beauty and being one of the richest indigenous rock art sites in
          south-eastern Australia.The Grampians feature a striking series of
          sandstone mountain ranges.

          The general form that the ranges take is: from the west, a series of
          low-angled sandstone ridges running roughly north-south. The eastern
          sides of the ridges, where the sedimentary layers have faulted, are
          steep and beyond the vertical in places - notably at Hollow Mountain
          near Dadswells Bridge at the northern end of the ranges. The most
          popular walking area for day trippers is the Wonderland area near
          Halls Gap. In summer the ranges can get very hot and dry. Winter and
          spring are the best times for walking. The Wonderland area is also
          host to "The Grand Canyon" on the "Wonderland Loop" on one of the
          tracks to the "Pinnacle". In spring, the Grampians wildflowers are an
          attraction. The area is a rock climbing destination, and it is visited
          by campers and bushwalkers for its many views and its natural
          environment.

          The Grampians Region is home to one of Australia's longest running
          food and wine festivals, Grampians Grape Escape, held over the first
          weekend of May in Halls Gap every year. Launched in 1992, the
          Grampians Grape Escape is a hallmark event for Victoria and provides
          food and wine offerings by more than 100 local artisan producers, live
          music and family entertainment.

          As at the 2016 Australian census, the Grampians region had a
          population of 236,739, with almost half of the population located in
          the City of Ballarat. The principal centres of the region, in
          descending order of population, are Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Horsham,
          Ararat, and Stawell.

          The iconic and spectacular MacKenzie Falls is a must do for all
          visitors to Grampians National Park. MacKenzie Falls is one of the
          largest waterfalls in Victoria. Flowing year round, the falls sees
          water cascade over huge cliffs into a deep pool, sending fine sprays
          of rainbow mist high into the air above a stunning gorge. To see the
          falls, take the easy, one-kilometre path to the viewing platform at
          the Bluff (wheelchair accessible), or the steep trail to the base of
          the falls (30 minutes one way).
        </p>
        <p>
          The walking track to the bottom of MacKenzie Falls is steep, but well
          worth the effort. The walk is 2 km return and includes a large section
          of steep steps as you make your way down into the gorge to the base of
          the falls. A viewing platform over Broken Falls is located before the
          walk heads down the steps - wheelchairs and prams can access the
          Broken Falls viewing platform, but no further.

          One of the most bio-diverse regions of Victoria, the Grampians
          National Park is often called the ‘Garden of Victoria’ and is home to
          one third of the state’s flora. The subalpine forest, heathlands,
          swamp, subalpine forest and riverine landscapes in the Grampians
          region also support a wide range of wildlife including plenty of
          iconic Australian fauna. Whilst it’s common to spot a koala, emu,
          kangaroo, wombat, echidna or platypus on one of our Grampians day
          tours, this week we thought we’d take a look at some of the lesser
          known flora and fauna that are unique to the Grampians region.
